This is a simple program that prints the
surface area and volume of a given shape, based on the 
given width, length and height. The program will require 
the user to first enter the shape, and then the dimensions.
If everything goes as expected, the program will print
the surface area and volume of the given shape, and a chance to
do additional shapes.
